# SnakeGame
This is a java project that alows you to play the classic game Snake! It can be altered to allow for different sized boards, faster or slower snakes, 
and other changes as well.
The base for this code was made in thanks to the wonderful youtube turorial of BroCode (https://youtu.be/bI6e6qjJ8JQ). All work as of the "Base Game" commit 
is from that tutorial.
